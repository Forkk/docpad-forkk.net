Hello, world! My name is Forkk, and welcome to my new blog thingy.

On this website, I'll be writing some words about some programming things and
maybe even letting other people read those words if they really want to. Or,
who knows, maybe I'll just end up talking to myself.

You probably aren't wondering: "Forkk, what happened to your old blog which
used to be here?" Well, I got rid of it. It was ugly and I didn't like it, so
I started over. Bootstrap sucks anyway, UIKit is awesome. If you really want
to access it, I've moved it to [oldsite.forkk.net](http://oldsite.forkk.net).
All the links are broken, though, since they point at forkk.net. I don't know
why you'd want to visit it anyway. The only thing on there that might be worth
visiting is the tic-tac-toe game, which I've moved over to this site as well.
You can find a link to it in the sidebar on the left.

Anyway, I should probably write something about myself. I'm some crazy person
who presses buttons on a computer repeatedly until the computer does things I
want it to. Sometimes it seems like there's some sort of pattern, as if there's
an actual meaning behind which buttons I press, but I'm still not sure on that
one yet.

This one time, I was pushing buttons and suddenly a [Minecraft launcher](http://multimc.org)
appeared. I named it [MultiMC](http://multimc.org). You should use it.

Well, that's all for now. I'll probably write more words later today or
something if I don't procrastinate it or get distracted.
